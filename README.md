### Hi there, I'm Sukhdeep ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer specializing in backend engineering with a keen interest in system architecture.

I share insights and write about various engineering topics on [X](https://x.com/sgillnotes). Additionally, I maintain a [blog](https://sukhdeep.tech/) where I write technical posts about what I've recently learned, aiming to explain concepts in a simple manner so that beginners can easily grasp them. My latest posts focus on design patterns with examples in Python.

To stay updated with the latest advancements, I actively read [engineering blogs](https://sukhdeep.tech/engineering-blogs/) and [ML-related research papers](https://sukhdeep.tech/annotated-research-papers/).
